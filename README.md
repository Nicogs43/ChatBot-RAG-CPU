# Navigating the Seas of AI Deploying Small Language Models on Compact Edge computer for Maritime Applications ðŸŒŠâ›µ

This repo contains the code implemented to create a Chat-bot based on a Small Language Model and integrate with R.A.G, optimized to run on a Intel CPU utilizing [OpenVINO toolkit]( https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino). 

Check [here](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/about-openvino/release-notes-openvino/system-requirements.html) if your device support OpenVINO.

This project was developed as my final work at UniversitÃ  di Genova MSc in Computer Science track Artificial Intelligence.

First of all you have to downlaod all the dependencies using: ```
pip install -r requirements.txt ```

To simple run the code you have to download the embedding model, reranker model if you want and a SLM.

Once download all the models you can see the code working using ``` python .\bin\main.py ```
