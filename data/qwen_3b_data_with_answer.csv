Entering the port of Civitavecchia at night presents a risk due to the difficulty in distinguishing the navigation lights from the town lights. Mariners must exercise caution to avoid collisions with structures like Capo Linaro, which is low and barren. It's also important to note that there have been recent developments within the port that require checking with the Port Authority for the latest information on depths.",Care should be exercised when entering the harbor at night as the navigation lights are not easily distinguished from the lights of the town.

Question: Can you describe to me the typical winds that affect the port of Trieste in winter ? 
Context: Mare Grande. Winds from the SE , especially in winter, are
strong and may disturb cargo handling by vessels berthed inPorto Mercantile. These winds us ually also bring mist and rain,
especially during May and June. In spring, strong W gusts of
wind blow over the roadstead. Th ey are generally of a brief du-
ration and slacken towa rds sunset. Winds from the E and S usu-
ally bring fog.

Gusts from the N, which may blow suddenly in winter, are, al-though rare, violent and dangerous for vessels in the harbor.
The Garigliano (wind from the NE to ENE) makes berthing
and unberthing difficult, particularly during the winter. Strongwinds from SE to SSW create a st rong surf along the coast, es-
pecially at Gaeta-Porto Salvo.

Can you describe to me the typical winds that affect the port of Trieste in winter?
<tool_call>ecastillo
In winter, the typical winds affecting the port of Trieste come from the southeast (SE), bringing strong and sometimes disruptive conditions for cargo handling in Porto Mercantile. These winds often coincide with mist and rain, particularly in May and June.","From September to March, winds alternate usually between the NW and NE. The NE winds blow sometimes with such force as to cause a sea in Mare Piccolo. Winds from the SW raise a lively sea and cause high water in Mare Grande. Winds from the SE, especially in winter, are strong and may disturb cargo handling by vessels berthed in Porto Mercantile."

I'm unsure if the specific details about currents in the port of Chioggia are widely documented, but generally, ports like Chioggia can experience ebb and flow currents influenced by the nearby Adriatic Sea's tides and the influence of the Gulf Stream. However, for precise information, one would need to consult local marine navigation charts or hydrographic reports.","Currents are strong and are mostly influenced by rain, run-off, and winds. With strong winds from the NE and SE, the current between the breakwaters can attain a rate up to 4 knots."

Is the roadstead in Portoferraio Bay safe for anchorage based on the given information?

Based on the provided context, the roadstead at Soverato Marina, which is one of the safest anchorages along the coast near Portoferraio Bay, is suitable for anchoring. It offers a depth of approximately 29 meters in sandy conditions, about 0.1 miles east-northeast of the church. However, local knowledge is still advised due to potential shallower areas caused by silt from nearby rivers.","Roadstead of Portoferraio affords anchorage to vessels of all sizes, but the bottom, being of soft mud, is not a good holding ground. With SE winds, which prevail in the area, vessels are liable to drag anchor, even when riding to two anchors. It is important to stay clear of the ferry turning areas and the harbor approaches. While ferry wash can sometimes cause some movement, it does not pose a significant danger for anchored vessels."
