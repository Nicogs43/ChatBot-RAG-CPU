<|assistant|> The roadstead in Portoferraio Bay is relatively safe for anchorage, as it is partially protected by a sandspit. However, the depths are shallower due to silt from a nearby river, so local knowledge is recommended. Vessels can anchor in a depth of 29m, about 0.1 mile offshore and ENE of the church.","Roadstead of Portoferraio affords anchorage to vessels of all sizes, but the bottom, being of soft mud, is not a good holding ground. With SE winds, which prevail in the area, vessels are liable to drag anchor, even when riding to two anchors. It is important to stay clear of the ferry turning areas and the harbor approaches. While ferry wash can sometimes cause some movement, it does not pose a significant danger for anchored vessels."
